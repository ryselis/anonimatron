 * Provides functionality for consitently anonymizing a piece of data.

 * consistently do so on each and every call.
 * 
 * By doing this, anonimatron can guarantee that data is transformed
 * consistently accross all tables of the database, and referential constraints
 * can be re-enforced after anonymization.
